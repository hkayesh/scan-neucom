# SCAN: A Shared Causal Attention Network for Adverse Drug Reactions Detection in Tweets

This repository contains the implementation of our model proposed in the paper "Humayun Kayesh, Md. Saiful Islam, Junhu Wang, 
Ryoma J. Ohira, Zhe Wang: SCAN: A shared causal attention network for adverse drug reactions detection in tweets. 
Neurocomputing 479: 60-74 (2022)". 

The code was developed and tested in Python 3.6. The scripts to prepares the datasets are provided in the repository. 
Run the `prep_train_test.sh` file to run the code. 


Note: This code is built on the code shared by Cococ et al. as a part of theie paper "Anne Cocos, Alexander G. Fiks, 
and Aaron J. Masino. Deep Learning for Pharmacovigilance: Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Labeling Adverse 
Drug Reactions in Twitter Posts." The URL to their original code is: https://github.com/chop-dbhi/twitter-adr-blstm
