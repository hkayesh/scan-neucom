Download the word2vec twitter model from:

http://yuca.test.iminds.be:8900/fgodin/downloads/word2vec_twitter_model.tar.gz (link last tested Sep 2016)

...and unpack in this directory. On Linux you can do this by running ./download_orig_datasets.sh from the base directory.

Make sure the W2VEC_TWTR_MODEL_PATH in settings.py points to the correct path
before running the LSTM.
